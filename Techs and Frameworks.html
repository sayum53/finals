 <h1> TECHS AND FRAMEWORK </h1>

  <p> In this app below web develpment languages were used: </p>

  <br>
  <p> Bootstrap 5: Bootstrap 5 was a new web development language for me, for
    example this apps navbar was made by bootstrap 5. This
    web development language is almost similar with HTML but has some
    modern features. I am confident with bootstrap 5 right now
  that I can make so many web development projects with this easily.</p>

  <br>
  <p>HTML: Most of the web development languages in this app is HTML.
  HTML is a foundation language which is required in all of the web development projects.
  I was confident with HTML before and still confident that
  in future projects and present projects I will use this language.</p>

  <br>
  <p> CSS:Cascading style sheet language was used in this project and also will
    be used in final project. Its good for designing a web app. For example the
    body of a hTML can be designed with this by different fonts
    and background pictures and also texts can be justified with this.</p>

  <br>
  <p> PHP: Most of the language used in this app was PHP. The login part is really cruicial in this app. For login and verification
  php language was used mostly. And also for data entry. Such as data entry in the article forms.</p>

  <br>
  <p> MySQL: The usage of local webserver is also vast in this app. As data are saved in the phpmyadmin servers. Not in the app.
    So MySql was handy in this matter </p>
